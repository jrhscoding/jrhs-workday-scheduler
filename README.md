  WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
  THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
  WHEN I click into a time block
  THEN I can enter an event
  WHEN I click the save button for that time block
  THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
  WHEN I refresh the page
